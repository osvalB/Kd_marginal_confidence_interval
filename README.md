This folder contains example code (in Python) to compute asymmetric confidence intervals
as presented in Vaida Paketuryte *et al.*, 2021. "Uncertainty in proteinâ€“ligand binding constants: asymmetric confidence intervals versus standard errors"

The idea is to select a parameter *p*, keep it fixed at different values, and minimize the residual sum of squares.
When a certain threshold is reached, the confidence interval is computed.
